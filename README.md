# **Codecademy Projects/Exercises**

## **Money Maker**
>You have three types of coins:
>
>+ A bronze coin is worth 1 cent
>
>+ A silver coin is worth 5 cents
>
>+ A gold coin is worth 10 cents
>
>What is the minimum number of coins that equals 98 cents?
>
>It’s a hard question to answer in your head, but it’s a fun problem to solve with programming. In this project you’ll use C# to build a Money Maker: a program in which a user enters an amount and gets the minimum number of coins that equal that value.
>
>For example, 16 cents could be:
>
>+ 16 bronze coins,
>+ 3 silver coins and 1 bronze coin, or
>+ 1 gold coin, 1 silver coin, 1 bronze coin
>
>We’d like the last option because it uses the fewest coins.

## **Password Checker**
>In this project you’ll make a program that measures the strength of any given password based on the following criteria. A strong password:
>
>+ is at least 8 characters long
>+ has lowercase letters
>+ has uppercase letters
>+ has numerical digits
>+ has symbols, like #, ?, !
>
>The program will ask the user to input a password, and using conditional logic and control flow, it will rate the password.

## **Caesar Cipher**
>The Caesar Cipher was used by the Roman empire to encode military secrets.
>
>To use the cipher, you draw the alphabet as a circle and take every letter of your message and shift it three places to the right. For example, A becomes D, B becomes E, Z becomes C, and “attack” becomes “dwwdfn”.
>
>You can also decipher your message by reversing the process: shift each letter three places to the left.
>
>The program will ask the user for a message and then if they'd like to Cipher or Decipher.
